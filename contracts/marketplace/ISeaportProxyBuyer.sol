     *
     * @param advancedOrder       The order to fulfill along with the fraction
     *                            of the order to attempt to fill. Note that
     *                            both the offerer and the fulfiller must first
     *                            approve this contract (or their preferred
     *                            conduit if indicated by the order) to transfer

     *                            components must have no remainder after
     *                            multiplication of the respective amount with
     *                            the supplied fraction for the partial fill to
     *                            be considered valid.
     * @param criteriaResolvers   An array where each element contains a
     *                            reference to a specific offer or
     *                            consideration, a token identifier, and a proof

     *                            proof needs to be supplied.
     * @param fulfillerConduitKey A bytes32 value indicating what conduit, if
     *                            any, to source the fulfiller's token approvals
     *                            from. The zero hash signifies that no conduit

     *                            Consideration.

     *                            with `address(0)` indicating that the caller
     *                            should receive the items.
